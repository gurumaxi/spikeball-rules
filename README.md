# Advanced spikeball rules 2023

### 1. Equipment and Court
* 1.1 - The tension on the net should be consistent throughout. A ball dropped from a height of 150 cm should bounce 50cm from the net, measuring from the bottom of the ball.
* 1.2 - When possible, a serving line circle should be drawn around the set. The distance from the edge of the set to the service line should be 213cm.

### 2. Serving
* 2.1 - Before serving and during the act of serving, all points of contact of the server must remain behind the service line.
* 2.2 - At least one foot must maintain a single point of contact with the ground until the ball hits the net.
* 2.3 - Serves may not be higher than a receiver's shoulder when in an athletic stance.
* 2.4 - Side pockets:
  * 2.4.1 - Left or right side of the net is determined relative to a center line parallel to the ball’s horizontal entry angle.
  * 2.4.2 - A ball hitting within the left third of the net (side pocket area) and moving right or a ball hitting within the right third of the net and moving left is is legal.
  * 2.4.3 - A ball hitting within the side pocket area and not moving the opposite direction is legal.
  * 2.4.4 - Every part of a ball which is hitting the back pocket (back third) of the net must land beyond the farthest point of the set relative to the ball’s horizontal angle of entry.

### 3. Playing the ball
* 3.1 - If teammates touch the ball simultaneously it is counted as two hits. Either teammate may take the next hit provided they have not already used all three hits.
* 3.2 - Players may not hit the ball with two hands.
* 3.3 - At the first hit of the team on a possession, a player may hit the ball once more consecutively, if their first hit occurs before the ball begins a downward trajectory. This action will be counted as a second hit.
  * 3.3.1 - Consecutive contacts as described in 3.3 are not allowed on serve receive.
  * 3.3.2 - Consecutive contacts as described in 3.3 cannot result in an immediate hit on the net.
* 3.4 - When a player contacts the set (rims, legs, or netting) during a rally, the point is lost.

### 4. Hinders
* 4.1 - The players whose turn it is to play the ball are entitled to freedom from interference by the opponents or another physical impediment.
* 4.2 - To avoid interference, players that are not playing the ball must make every effort to provide the other players with:
  * 4.2.1 - Unobstructed direct access to the ball after completion of a reasonable followthrough.
  * 4.2.2 - Freedom to hit the ball with a reasonable swing.
* 4.3 - A hinder occurs if the opponent fails to fulfill any of the requirements of 4.2.1 or 4.2.2, even if the opponent makes every effort to fulfill those requirements. If the opponent made every effort to avoid the interference, the round will be replayed. Otherwise, the hindered team is awarded a point.

### 5. Making Calls and Settling Disagreements
* Infractions and hinders must be called immediately after occurrence.
* If teams cannot determine the legality of a hit, serve, or call (when observers are not present), they must replay the point. Teammates do not have to agree with each other for that team to issue a disagreement. If three players think one thing, and the fourth player still disagrees after discussion, this merits replaying the point.
